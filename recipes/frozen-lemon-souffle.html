        <h3>Ingredients: </h3>
        <ul>
            <li> 8 large eggs, separated </li>
            <li> 1 cup (8 oz/225 g) granulated sugar </li> 
            <li> 2 teaspoons lemon zest </li>
            <li> 2 teaspoons lime zest </li>
            <li> ½ cup (4 fl oz/120 ml) lemon juice, freshly squeezed </li>
            <li> ¼ cup (2 fl oz/60 ml) lime juice, freshly squeezed </li>
            <li> ¼ teaspoon salt </li>
            <li> ⅔ cup (5 fl oz/142 ml) heavy cream </li>
        </ul>

        <h3> For the garnish </h3>

        <ul>
            <li> Whipped cream </li>
            <li> 2 teaspoons lemon and lime zest </li>
        </ul>


        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Cut a piece of aluminum foil large enough to wrap around the outside of a 6-cup (48 fl oz/1500 ml) capacity souffle mold.</li> </br>
            <li> Fold the foil in half lengthwise, then wrap it around the souffle mold so that the foil extends 3 inches (7 ½ cm) above the rim of the mold, and secure it with tape. (Be patient with yourself – it can be easier said than done!) Set aside.
            </li> </br>
            <li> Place the egg yolks in a medium bowl next to the stove and place a separate clean bowl with a fine mesh sieve on top also near the stove.  </li> </br>
            <li> In a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, combine the sugar, zest, and juice and heat until simmering. </li> </br>
            <li> Whisk the egg yolks while adding the hot lemon-lime mixture, one ladleful at a time, until it is incorporated. </li> </br>
            <li> Return the mixture to the saucepan and cook on low heat, stirring constantly for 3 to 5 minutes, until the mixture thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon. Do not let this boil or it can curdle. </li> </br>
            <li> Immediately pass the curd through the sieve, then place the bowl in a larger bowl filled with ice water to cool the mix and stop it cooking. Allow to cool here, stirring occasionally. </li> </br>
            <li> Place the egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment (or use a handheld electric mixer and a medium bowl). </li> </br>
            <li> Whip the whites on medium speed for 2 minutes until foamy and thickened, then increase the speed to high and whip to stiff peaks, 3 to 4 minutes. Fold the whipped whites into the chilled curd using a thin-edged metal spoon. </li> </br>
            <li> In the same bowl used to whip the whites, add the heavy cream and whip on high speed until it reaches medium-stiff peaks, 2 to 3 minutes. Fold this gently into the mixture. </li> </br>
            <li> Pour the souffle into the prepared mold and freeze for at least 6 hours, but preferably overnight. </li> </br>
            <li> Carefully unmold and serve with some softly whipped cream and a little zest. Cover and store leftovers back in the freezer for up to a week. </li> </br>
        </ol>
