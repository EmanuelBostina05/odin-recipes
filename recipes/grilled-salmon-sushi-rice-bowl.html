        <h3>Description</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> 1 cup cooked rice – warm </li> </br>
            <li> 1½ tbsp sushi vinegar </li> </br>
            <li> 4 oz skinless fresh salmon filet </li> </br>
            <li> mayonnaise </li> </br>
            <li> okonomi sauce </li> </br>
            <li> ½ avocado – cut into ½ cubes (optional) </li> </br>
            <li> 1 egg (optional) </li> </br>
            <li> 1 tsp light soy sauce </li> </br>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Add 1 cup of warm cooked rice and 1 ½ tbsp of sushi vinegar to a large bowl. Mix well, transfer the rice to a serving plate. </li> </br>
            <li> Shape the rice into a donut shape. </li> </br>
            <li> Hold a knife at a 45° angle to the cutting board, slice a 4oz salmon filet into 10 to 12 thin slices. Arrange the salmon slices in a single layer on top of the rice. </li> </br>
            <li>  Use a kitchen torch to sear each slice of the salmon for about 3 seconds, until the salmon slice is sizzling with oil releasing from the surface. </li> </br>
            <li> Drizzle sauce of your choice over the seared salmon. I used mayonnaise and okonomi sauce. You may want to use one light color sauce, and one dark color sauce for the best looking and taste. </li> </br>
            <li> Put avocado cubes in the center of the rice. Use a kitchen torch to sear the sauce for about 15 seconds until it’s sizzling and slightly caramelized. </li> </br>
            <li> Crack the soft cooked egg on the top of avocado cubes. Drizzle 1 tsp of light soy sauce on the egg. </li> </br>
            <li> Serve immediately. Use a spoon to get some rice, a slice of salmon, a piece of avocado, dip some egg yolk, then enjoy how every ingredient melts in your mouth. </li> </br>
        </ol>
